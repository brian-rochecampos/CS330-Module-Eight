CS 330 Comp Graphic and Visualization (Module Eight Journal Reflection)

1. How do I approach designing software?
When I design software, I usually start by thinking about what I want to make and how it should look or work. Then I break it down into smaller steps. For this 3D project, I started with the basic shapes first, then added more details like textures, colors, and lighting. I’ve realized that having a plan before I start coding makes everything easier and helps me stay organized when things get complicated.

- What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project really helped me understand how to make 3D objects look more realistic. I got better at adjusting shapes, lighting, and textures to make things look right. For example, I learned how small changes like curving edges or adding shadows can make a huge difference in how real something looks.

- What design process did you follow for your project work?
My design process was basically to build, test, and improve. I’d start simple, look at how it turned out, then go back and fix what didn’t look right. I did that a lot while working on the book model I kept tweaking the angles, lighting, and the divider until it looked good.

- How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I think this approach of testing and improving can work in any project I do later. Instead of trying to make something perfect the first time, I can just focus on getting a rough version done and then keep improving it. It saves time and helps me notice details I might’ve missed otherwise.

2. How do I approach developing programs?
When I’m developing programs, I like to start with the basics and make sure they actually work before I add more stuff. I’ve learned that it’s way easier to build something step by step instead of trying to do everything at once. I also test my code often to make sure nothing breaks when I change something.

- What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I got better at organizing my code and using functions to separate parts of my scene, like the book, pen, and ink pot. I also played around a lot with scaling, rotations, and textures to make things look smoother. Basically, I learned how to make my 3D objects not look flat and more like something real.

- How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was a big part of my project. I probably rebuilt and adjusted things a dozen times. Each time I’d notice something new that could be improved, like the way the pages curved or how the lighting hit the book. It was a lot of trial and error, but that’s how it got better every time.

- How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
At the start, I was mostly focused on just getting my scene to show up correctly. Later on, I started paying more attention to details and how to make it look realistic. I also learned how to make my code cleaner and easier to change later. Overall, I got more confident with transformations and using small tweaks to make big improvements.

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science gives me skills that I can use in a lot of different areas. It teaches me how to solve problems and think logically, which helps no matter what I’m doing. I also like that it lets me be creative like mixing art and code together in this project. It makes me feel like I can build almost anything if I take the time to learn how. I had a lot of fun in this course. It was genuinely fun to me.

- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Working on 3D graphics helped me understand how math and programming actually come together to make things move and look real. I think that’ll really help me in future classes, especially ones about game design or simulations. It also made me realize how much small details matter when trying to make something look realistic, which is something I’ll keep in mind for future projects.

- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
These skills could definitely help me in jobs that involve games, design, or any kind of visual software. Knowing how to make and use 3D models could make my work look more polished and help me show ideas in a clearer way. It also showed me how important visuals are for catching people’s attention and making a project look complete.
